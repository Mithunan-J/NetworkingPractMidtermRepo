NetworkingLecture3Sockets2 - just 2 visual studio projects basic chat with a server and client

NetworkUDPLecture4 - a unity and visual studio combo, server is vs console while client is Unity (ne3Client, SampleScene) - client sends position of cube to server which prints it to its console. This is a good project, because the server finds the ip address by itself. Reminder: This one uses strings

NetworkingLecture5Async - the original 2 vs projects. Client sends a couple of float values to the server. Both the server and client write the values in their consoles. This one works with floats.

Notes to myself:
I'm using 2 unity projects: ne3Client and ne3Server.
ne3Client is the "first client".
ne3Server is the "second client".

Current ports I am using:
First Client (ne3Client) uses 8888 for TCP and 8889 for UDP
Second Client (ne3Server) uses 8887 for TCP and 8890 for UDP

Currently I am able to send position updates from both clients to the server using UDP.
My TCP connections are also working. Currently they post a message to the server's console when a new client connects to a port.

My current problem is sending messages from the server to the clients using UDP.


UPDATES (March 17, 2023 // 12:07 pm)
The tcp chat works, I just have to apply it to both unity projects instead of the just the one it was made on.
The udp sends position updates. It will send client 2's position updates to client 1 and client 1's position updates to client 2.

NEXT STEP: Make the cubes move!
